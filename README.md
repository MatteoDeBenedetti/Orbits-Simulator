## Orbits Simulator

The objective of this project is to create a 2D orbits simulator in Unity

It shows the spacecraft in orbit around a primary body (Earth) and a trace of its orbit.
In the top right the user can select a time multiplier to speed up the time of the simulation up to 100x

Two Sliders in the bottom left of the screen allow the user to change Semi Major Axis and Eccentricity.
